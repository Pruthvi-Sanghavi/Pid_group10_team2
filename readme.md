## Basic running guide

#mkdir build
#cd build
#cmake ..
#make
#make test
#cd test
#Run program: ./	cpp-test

## Overview 

The project contains a PID control which uses compute function. Travis and Coveralls are used for code coverage.

## Notes

-Do we need to update the UML diagram? Nothing has really changed. 
-Do we all have enough comments here? We should all make sure we have the right doxygen comments. 
-Should we exclude main and lib? 
-What else can we add to the running guide? 
-Do we need a separate Doxygen tag for class, in addition to file?

## To Do Statements

-Code works correctly 
-Agreed upon comments in all of our sections 
-Discussed testing for projects 
--Could possibly add corner cases 
--Could add test for error detection and null inputs 
--Passing illegal values into the class
